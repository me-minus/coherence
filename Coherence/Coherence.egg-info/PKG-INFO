Description: Coherence is a framework written in Python,
        providing a variety of UPnP MediaServer and UPnP MediaRenderer implementations
        for instant use.
        
        It includes an UPnP ControlPoint, which is accessible via D-Bus too.
        
        Furthermore it enables your application to participate in
        digital living networks, at the moment primarily the DLNA/UPnP universe.
        Its objective and demand is to relieve your application from all the
        membership/the UPnP related tasks as much as possible.
        
        New in this 0.6.6 - the Red-Nosed Reindeer - release
        
        * new MediaServer backends that allow access to
        * Banshee - exports audio and video files from Banshees media db (http://banshee-project.org/)
        * FeedStore - a MediaServer serving generic RSS feeds
        * Playlist - exposes the list of video/audio streams from a m3u playlist (e.g. web TV listings published by french ISPs such as Free, SFR...)
        * YAMJ - serves the movie/TV series data files and metadata from a given YAMJ (Yet Another Movie Jukebox) library (http://code.google.com/p/moviejukebox/)
        * updates on Mirabeau - our "UPnP over XMPP" bridge
        * simplifications in the D-Bus API
        * a first implementation of an JSON/REST API
        * advancements of the GStreamer MediaRenderer, supporting now GStreamers playbin2
        * upgrade of the DVB-Daemon MediaServer
        * refinements in the transcoding section, having now the choice to use GStreamer pipelines or external processes like mencoder
        * more 'compatibility' improvements for different devices (e.g. Samsung TVs or Apache Felix)
        * and - as every time - the usual bugfixes and enhancements
